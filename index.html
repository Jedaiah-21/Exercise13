            AMA University and Colleges are fully capable of providing alternative ways of studying as pre-pandemic,its campuses already offered Blended Learning, wherein students had a dynamic mix of classroom-based classes and online modules. Backed by its technological expertise as the country’s pioneer in IT education, AMA is more than ready to implement full-online learning until quarantines are lifted.
            
            Understanding the risks and apprehensions of students and their parents, AMA University and Colleges will continue its full-online set-up until it is safe for physical classes to resume. Once that happens, the schools will then shift to a Blended Learning set-up. The full-online option is now available for new and returning students.
            
            “As an educational institution, we recognize our responsibility in keeping our students as well as our educators safe. The threat of the coronavirus calls for a sustainable and flexible set-up that enables continued learning,”said Dr. Amable R. Aguiluz V, Founder and Chairman of AMA Education System who is considered as the father of IT education in the Philippines.“Our infrastructure and systems are equipped to accommodate students and ensure that they are able to continue their studies during this challenging time.”</p>
